# ShipheadJS

## Overview
A rebuild of my previous project: [`shiphead`](https://github.com/scarletti-ben/shiphead), which was a card game from my childhood built in `Python`, this time built in `JavaScript`


> [!NOTE]  
> The `playing-card` elements resize when they do not fit in `played` div, and have empty space below the bottom of their resized internal `SVG`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks
